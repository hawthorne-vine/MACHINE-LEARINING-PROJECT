# MACHINE-LEARINING-PROJECT
Project on Comparative analysis between ANN and CNN for sound classification

ABSTRACT - Audio Classification or Sound Classification 
plays an important role in many AI models such as speech 
recognition, virtual assistant, text to speech applications 
and voice translators, This Report describes our work on 
the difference in Audio Classification by using two machine 
learning algorithm i.e. Artificial Neural Networks and 
Convolutional Neural Networks. We applied both the 
models on ESC-50 dataset. And from that we have achieved 
the accuracy of 0.82 (using CNN model) and 0.65 (using 
ANN model). Thus reaching to our conclusion that CNN is 
better than ANN model in audio classification technique.
